## 👨‍💻 About Me

AI-Integrated Software Engineer focused on building scalable, production-grade systems that combine strong computer science fundamentals with applied machine learning.

Currently pursuing B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science, I design and implement end-to-end systems across frontend, backend, and ML layers. My work emphasizes clean architecture, modular service design, API abstraction, structured validation pipelines, and deployment-ready engineering practices.

I’m particularly interested in building systems that balance algorithmic efficiency, maintainability, and real-world scalability.

## 🧠 Core Engineering Focus

- Designing backend services with clear separation of concerns  
- Structuring ML pipelines from preprocessing → training → evaluation → inference  
- Building RESTful APIs with authentication, validation, and error handling  
- Applying algorithmic thinking to optimize performance and system flow  
- Writing modular, testable, and maintainable code

## 🧩 System Design & Problem-Solving Approach

When building systems, I focus on:

1. Defining clear input-output boundaries  
2. Structuring components with minimal coupling  
3. Evaluating time and space complexity where applicable  
4. Designing APIs that are predictable and extensible  
5. Ensuring validation and error handling are first-class concerns
